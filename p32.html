<a name="W2.49"></a>
<a name="section1"></a>
Sec. 1.  This paper is based upon the theory already
established, that the function of conceptions is to reduce the
manifold of sensuous impressions to unity, and that the validity
of a conception consists in the impossibility of reducing the
content of consciousness to unity without the introduction of it.

<p>

<a name="CP1.546"></a>
<a name="section2"></a>
  Sec. 2.  This theory gives rise to a conception of
gradation among those conceptions which are universal. For one
such conception may unite the manifold of sense and yet another
may be required to unite the conception and the manifold to which
it is applied; and so on.

<p>

<a name="CP1.547"></a>
<a name="section3"></a>
  Sec. 3.  That universal conception which is nearest to
sense is that of <i>the present, in general</i>. This is a conception,
because it is universal. But as the act of <i>attention</i> has no
connotation at all, but is the pure denotative power of the mind,
that is to say, the power which directs the mind to an object, in
contradistinction to the power of thinking any predicate of that
object, -- so the conception of <i>what is present in general</i>,
which is nothing but the general recognition of what is contained
in attention, has no connotation, and therefore no proper unity.
This conception of the present in general, of IT in general, is
rendered in philosophical language by the word "substance" in one
of its meanings. Before any comparison or discrimination can be
made between what is present, what is present must have been
recognized as such, as <i>it</i>, and subsequently the metaphysical
parts which are recognized by abstraction are attributed to this
<i>it</i>, but the <i>it</i> cannot itself be made a predicate. This <i>it</i> is
thus neither predicated of a subject, nor in a subject, and
accordingly is identical with the conception of substance.

<p>

<a name="CP1.548"></a>
<a name="section4"></a>  Sec. 4.  The unity to which the understanding reduces
impressions is the unity of a proposition. This unity consists in
the connection of the predicate with the subject; and, therefore,
that which is implied in the copula, or the conception of <i>being,</i>
is that which completes the <a name="W2.50"></a>work of conceptions of reducing
the manifold to unity. The copula (or rather the verb which is
copula in one of its senses) means either <i>actually is</i> or <i>would
be,</i> as in the two propositions, "There <i>is</i> no griffin," and "A
griffin <i>is</i> a winged quadruped." The conception of <i>being</i>
contains only that junction of predicate to subject wherein these
two verbs agree. The conception of being, therefore, plainly has
no content.

<p>

      If we say "The stove is black," the stove is the substance,
from which its blackness has not been differentiated, and the is,
while it leaves the substance just as it was seen, explains its
confusedness, by the application to it of <i>blackness</i> as a
predicate.

<p>

      Though <i>being</i> does not affect the subject, it implies an
indefinite determinability of the predicate. For if one could know
the copula and predicate of any proposition, as ". . . is a
tailed-man," he would know the predicate to be applicable to
something supposable, at least. Accordingly, we have propositions
whose subjects are entirely indefinite, as "There is a beautiful
ellipse," where the subject is merely <i>something actual or
potential</i>; but we have no propositions whose predicate is
entirely indeterminate, for it would be quite senseless to say,
"<i>A</i> has the common characters of all things," inasmuch as there
are no such common characters.

<p>

      Thus substance and being are the beginning and end of all
conception. Substance is inapplicable to a predicate, and being is
equally so to a subject.

<p>

<a name="CP1.549"></a>
<a name="section5"></a>
  Sec. 5.  The terms "prescision" and "abstraction," which
were formerly applied to every kind of separation, are now
limited, not merely to mental separation, but to that which arises
from <i>attention to</i> one element and <i>neglect of</i> the other.
Exclusive attention consists in a definite conception or
<i>supposition</i> of one part of an object, without any supposition of
the other. Abstraction or prescision ought to be carefully
distinguished from two other modes of mental separation, which may
be termed <i>discrimination</i> and <i>dissociation</i>. Discrimination has
to do merely with the senses of terms, and only draws a
distinction in meaning. Dissociation is that separation which, in
the absence of a constant association, is permitted by the law of
association of images. It is the consciousness of one thing,
without the necessary simultaneous consciousness of the other.
Abstraction or prescision, therefore, supposes a greater
separation than discrimination, but a less separation than
dissociation. Thus I can discriminate red from blue, space from
color, and color from space, but not red <a name="W2.51"></a>from color. I can
prescind red from blue, and space from color (as is manifest from
the fact that I actually believe there is an uncolored space
between my face and the wall); but I cannot prescind color from
space, nor red from color. I can dissociate red from blue, but not
space from color, color from space, nor red from color.

<p>

      Prescision is not a reciprocal process. It is frequently the
case, that, while A cannot be prescinded from B, B can be
prescinded from A. This circumstance is accounted for as follows.
Elementary conceptions only arise upon the occasion of experience;
that is, they are produced for the first time according to a
general law, the condition of which is the existence of certain
impressions. Now if a conception does not reduce the impressions
upon which it follows to unity, it is a mere arbitrary addition to
these latter; and elementary conceptions do not arise thus
arbitrarily. But if the impressions could be definitely
comprehended without the conception, this latter would not reduce
them to unity. Hence, the impressions (or more immediate
conceptions) cannot be definitely conceived or attended to, to the
neglect of an elementary conception which reduces them to unity.
On the other hand, when such a conception has once been obtained,
there is, in general, no reason why the premisses which have
occasioned it should not be neglected, and therefore the
explaining conception may frequently be prescinded from the more
immediate ones and from the impressions.

<p>

<a name="CP1.550"></a>
<a name="section6"></a>
  Sec. 6.  The facts now collected afford the basis for a
systematic method of searching out whatever universal elementary
conceptions there may be intermediate between the manifold of
substance and the unity of being. It has been shown that the
occasion of the introduction of a universal elementary conception
is either the reduction of the manifold of substance to unity, or
else the conjunction to substance of another conception. And it
has further been shown that the elements conjoined cannot be
supposed without the conception, whereas the conception can
generally be supposed without these elements. Now, empirical
psychology discovers the occasion of the introduction of a
conception, and we have only to ascertain what conception already
lies in the data which is united to that of substance by the first
conception, but which cannot be supposed without this first
conception, to have the next conception in order in passing from
being to substance.

<p>

      It may be noticed that, throughout this process,
<i>introspection</i> is not resorted to. Nothing is assumed respecting
the subjective ele<a name="W2.52"></a>ments of consciousness which cannot be
securely inferred from the objective elements.

<p>

<a name="CP1.551"></a>
<a name="section7"></a>
  Sec. 7.  The conception of <i>being</i> arises upon the
formation of a proposition. A proposition always has, besides a
term to express the substance, another to express the quality of
that substance; and the function of the conception of being is to
unite the quality to the substance. Quality, therefore, in its
very widest sense, is the first conception in order in passing
from being to substance.

<p>

        Quality seems at first sight to be given in the
impression. Such results of introspection are untrustworthy. A
proposition asserts the applicability of a mediate conception to a
more immediate one. Since this is <i>asserted</i>, the more mediate
conception is clearly regarded independently of this circumstance,
for otherwise the two conceptions would not be distinguished, but
one would be thought through the other, without this latter being
an object of thought, at all. The mediate conception, then, in
order to be <i>asserted</i> to be applicable to the other, must first
be considered without regard to this circumstance, and taken
immediately. But, taken immediately, it transcends what is given
(the more immediate conception), and its applicability to the
latter is hypothetical. Take, for example, the proposition, "This
stove is black." Here the conception of <i>this stove</i> is the more
immediate, that of <i>black</i> the more mediate, which latter, to be
predicated of the former, must be discriminated from it and
considered <i>in itself</i>, not as applied to an object, but simply as
embodying a quality, <i>blackness</i>. Now this <i>blackness</i> is a pure
species or abstraction, and its application to <i>this stove</i> is
entirely hypothetical. The same thing is meant by "the stove is
black," as by "there is blackness in the stove." <i>Embodying
blackness</i> is the equivalent of <i>black</i>.<a href="#note1">***</a><a name="notemark1"></a> The proof is this.
These conceptions are applied indifferently to precisely the same
facts. If, therefore, they were different, the one which was first
applied would fulfil every function of the other; so that one of
them would be superfluous. Now a superfluous conception is an
arbitrary fiction, whereas elementary conceptions arise only upon
the requirement of experience; so that a superfluous elementary
conception is impossible. Moreover, the conception of a pure
abstraction is indispensable, because we cannot comprehend an
agreement of two things, except as an agreement in some <i>respect</i>,
<a name="W2.53"></a>and this respect is such a pure abstraction as blackness. Such
a pure abstraction, reference to which constitutes a <i>quality</i> or
general attribute, may be termed a <i>ground</i>.

<p>

      Reference to a ground cannot be prescinded from being, but
being can be prescinded from it.

<p>

<a name="CP1.552"></a>
<a name="section8"></a>
  Sec. 8.  Empirical psychology has established the fact that
we can know a quality only by means of its contrast with or
similarity to another. By contrast and agreement a thing is
referred to a correlate, if this term may be used in a wider sense
than usual. The occasion of the introduction of the conception of
reference to a ground is the reference to a correlate, and this
is, therefore, the next conception in order.

<p>

      Reference to a correlate cannot be prescinded from reference
to a ground; but reference to a ground may be prescinded from
reference to a correlate.

<p>

<a name="CP1.553"></a>
<a name="section9"></a>
  Sec. 9.  The occasion of reference to a correlate is
obviously by comparison. This act has not been sufficiently
studied by the psychologists, and it will, therefore, be necessary
to adduce some examples to show in what it consists. Suppose we
wish to compare the letters p and b. We may imagine one of them to
be turned over on the line of writing as an axis, then laid upon
the other, and finally to become transparent so that the other can
be seen through it. In this way we shall form a new image which
mediates between the images of the two letters, inasmuch as it
represents one of them to be (when turned over) he likeness of the
other. Again, suppose we think of a murderer as being in relation
to a murdered person; in this case we conceive the act of the
murder, and in this conception it is represented that
corresponding to every murderer (as well as to every murder) there
is a murdered person; and thus we resort again to a mediating
representation which represents the relate as standing for a
correlate with which the mediating representation is itself in
relation. Again, suppose we look up the word <i>homme</i> in a French
dictionary; we shall find opposite to it the word <i>man</i>, which, so
placed, represents <i>homme</i> as representing the same two-legged
creature which <i>man</i> itself represents. By a further accumulation
of instances, it would be found that every comparison requires,
besides the related thing, the ground, and the correlate, also <i>a
mediating representation which represents the relate to be a
representation of the same correlate which this mediating
representation itself represents</i>. Such a mediating representation
may be termed an <i>interpretant</i>, <a name="W2.54"></a>because it fulfils the office
of an interpreter, who says that a foreigner says the same thing
which he himself says. The term "representation" is here to be
understood in a very extended sense, which can be explained by
instances better than by a definition. In this sense, a word
represents a thing to the conception in the mind of the hearer, a
portrait represents the person for whom it is intended to the
conception of recognition, a weathercock represents the direction
of the wind to the conception of him who understands it, a
barrister represents his client to the judge and jury whom he
influences.

<p>

      Every reference to a correlate, then, conjoins to the
substance the conception of a reference to an interpretant; and
this is, therefore, the next conception in order in passing from
being to substance.

<p>

      Reference to an interpretant cannot be prescinded from
reference to a correlate; but the latter can be prescinded from
the former.

<p>

<a name="CP1.554"></a>
<a name="section10"></a>
  Sec. 10.  Reference to an interpretant is rendered possible
and justified by that which renders possible and justifies
comparison. But that is clearly the diversity of impressions. If
we had but one impression, it would not require to be reduced to
unity, and would therefore not need to be thought of as referred
to an interpretant, and the conception of reference to an
interpretant would not arise. But since there is a manifold of
impressions, we have a feeling of complication or confusion, which
leads us to differentiate this impression from that, and then,
having been differentiated, they require to be brought to unity.
Now they are not brought to unity until we conceive them together
as being <i>ours</i>, that is, until we refer them to a conception as
their interpretant. Thus, the reference to an interpretant arises
upon the holding together of diverse impressions, and therefore it
does not join a conception to the substance, as the other two
references do, but unites directly the manifold of the substance
itself. It is, therefore, the last conception in order in passing
from being to substance.

<p>

<a name="CP1.555"></a>
<a name="section11"></a>
  Sec. 11.  The five conceptions thus obtained, for reasons
which will be sufficiently obvious, may be termed <i>categories</i>.
That is,

<p>

<blockquote>
     BEING<br>
      
<blockquote>
            Quality (Reference to a Ground),<br>
            
            Relation (Reference to a Correlate),<br>
            
            Representation (Reference to an Interpretant),<br>
            
</blockquote>            
      SUBSTANCE
</blockquote>            
      
      <p>

      <a name="W2.55"></a>The three intermediate conceptions may be termed
accidents.

<p>

<a name="CP1.556"></a>
<a name="section12"></a>
  Sec. 12.  This passage from the many to the one is
numerical. The conception of a <i>third</i> is that of an object which
is so related to two others, that one of these must be related to
the other in the same way in which the third is related to that
other. Now this coincides with the conception of an interpretant.
An <i>other</i> is plainly equivalent to a <i>correlate</i>. The conception
of second differs from that of other, in implying the possibility
of a third. In the same way, the conception of <i>self</i> implies the
possibility of an <i>other</i>. The <i>Ground</i> is the self abstracted
from the concreteness which implies the possibility of an other.

<p>

<a name="CP1.557"></a>
<a name="section13"></a>
  Sec. 13.  Since no one of the categories can be prescinded
from those above it, the list of supposable objects which they
afford is,

<p>

<blockquote>
      What is.<br>
      
<blockquote>
            Quale--that which refers to a ground,<br>
            
            Relate--that which refers to ground and correlate,<br>
            
            Representamen--that which refers to ground, correlate,
              and interpretant.<br>
              
</blockquote>            
      It.
</blockquote>            
      
      <p>

<a name="CP1.558"></a>
<a name="section14"></a>
  Sec. 14.  A quality may have a special determination which
prevents its being prescinded from reference to a correlate. Hence
there are two kinds of relation.

<p>

      First. That of relates whose reference to a ground is a
prescindible or internal quality.

<p>

      Second. That of relates whose reference to a ground is an
unprescindible or relative quality.

<p>

      In the former case, the relation is a mere <i>concurrence</i> of
the correlates in one character, and the relate and correlate are
not distinguished. In the latter case the correlate is set over
against the relate, and there is in some sense an <i>opposition</i>.

<p>

      Relates of the first kind are brought into relation simply
by their agreement. But mere disagreement (unrecognized) does not
constitute relation, and therefore relates of the second kind are
only brought into relation by correspondence in fact.

<p>

      A reference to a ground may also be such that it cannot be
prescinded from a reference to an interpretant. In this case it
may be termed an <i>imputed</i> quality. If the reference of a relate
to its ground <a name="W2.56"></a>can be prescinded from reference to an
interpretant, its relation to its correlate is a mere concurrence
or community in the possession of a quality, and therefore the
reference to a correlate can be prescinded from reference to an
interpretant. It follows that there are three kinds of
representations.

<p>

      First. Those whose relation to their objects is a mere
community in some quality, and these representations may be termed
<i>Likenesses</i>.

<p>

      Second. Those whose relation to their objects consists in a
correspondence in fact, and these may be termed <i>Indices</i> or
<i>Signs</i>.

<p>

      Third. Those the ground of whose relation to their objects
is an imputed character, which are the same as <i>general signs</i>,
and these may be termed <i>Symbols</i>.

<p>

<a name="CP1.559"></a>
<a name="section15"></a>
  Sec. 15.  I shall now show how the three conceptions of
reference to a ground, reference to an object, and reference to an
interpretant are the fundamental ones of at least one universal
science, that of logic. Logic is said to treat of second
intentions as applied to first. It would lead me too far away from
the matter in hand to discuss the truth of this statement; I shall
simply adopt it as one which seems to me to afford a good
definition of the subject-genus of this science. Now, second
intentions are the objects of the understanding considered as
representations, and the first intentions to which they apply are
the objects of those representations. The objects of the
understanding, considered as representations, are symbols, that
is, signs which are at least potentially general. But the rules of
logic hold good of any symbols, of those which are written or
spoken as well as of those which are thought. They have no
immediate application to likenesses or indices, because no
arguments can be constructed of these alone, but do apply to all
symbols. All symbols, indeed, are in one sense relative to the
understanding, but only in the sense in which also all things are
relative to the understanding. On this account, therefore, the
relation to the understanding need not be expressed in the
definition of the sphere of logic, since it determines no
limitation of that sphere. But a distinction can be made between
concepts which are supposed to have no existence except so far as
they are actually present to the understanding, and external
symbols which still retain their character of symbols so long as
they are only <i>capable</i> of being understood. And as the rules of
logic apply to these latter as much as to the former (and though
only through the former, yet this character, since it belongs to
all things, is no limitation), it follows that logic has for its
subject-genus all symbols and not merely con<a name="W2.57"></a>cepts.<a href="#note2">***</a><a name="notemark2"></a> We
come, therefore, to this, that logic treats of the reference of
symbols in general to their objects. In this view it is one of a
trivium of conceivable sciences. The first would treat of the
formal conditions of symbols having meaning, that is of the
reference of symbols in general to their grounds or imputed
characters, and this might be called formal grammar; the second,
logic, would treat of the formal conditions of the truth of
symbols; and the third would treat of the formal conditions of the
force of symbols, or their power of appealing to a mind, that is,
of their reference in general to interpretants, and this might be
called formal rhetoric.

<p>

      There would be a general division of symbols, common to all
these sciences; namely, into,

<p>

      1)  Symbols which directly determine only their <i>grounds</i> or
imputed qualities, and are thus but sums of marks or <i>terms</i>;

<p>

      2)  Symbols which also independently determine their
<i>objects</i> by means of other term or terms, and thus, expressing
their own objective validity, become capable of truth or
falsehood, that is, are <i>propositions</i>; and,

<p>

      3)  Symbols which also independently determine their
<i>interpretants</i>, and thus the minds to which they appeal, by
premissing a proposition or propositions which such a mind is to
admit. These are <i>arguments</i>.

<p>

      And it is remarkable that, among all the definitions of the
proposition, for example, as the <i>oratio indicativa</i>, as the
subsumption of an object under a concept, as the expression of the
relation of two concepts, and as the indication of the mutable
ground of appearance, there is, perhaps, not one in which the
conception of reference to an object or correlate is not the
important one. In the same way, the conception of reference to an
interpretant or third, is always prominent in the definitions of
argument.

<p>

      In a proposition, the term which separately indicates the
object of the symbol is termed the subject, and that which
indicates the ground is termed the predicate. The objects
indicated by the subject (which are always potentially a plurality
-- at least, of phases or <a name="W2.58"></a>appearances) are therefore stated by
the proposition to be related to one another on the ground of the
character indicated by the predicate. Now this relation may be
either a concurrence or an opposition. Propositions of concurrence
are those which are usually considered in logic; but I have shown
in a paper upon the classification of arguments that it is also
necessary to consider separately propositions of opposition, if we
are to take account of such arguments as the following: --

<p>

      Whatever is the half of anything is less than that of which
it is the half:

<p>
<center>

                        A is half of B:<br>
                        
                        A is less than B.
</center>
                   
                   <p>

      The subject of such a proposition is separated into two
terms, a "subject nominative" and an "object accusative."

<p>

      In an argument, the premisses form a representation of the
conclusion, because they indicate the interpretant of the
argument, or representation representing it to represent its
object. The premisses may afford a likeness, index, or symbol of
the conclusion. In deductive argument, the conclusion is
represented by the premisses as by a general sign under which it
is contained. In hypotheses, something like the conclusion is
proved, that is, the premisses form a likeness of the conclusion.
Take, for example, the following argument:

<p>
<center>

          M is, for instance, P', P'', P''', and P'''';<br>
          
          S is P', P'', P''', and P'''':<br>
          
     [Ergo,] S is M.
</center>     
     <p>

      Here the first premiss amounts to this, that "P', P'', P''',
and P''''" is a likeness of M, and thus the premisses are or
represent a likeness of the conclusion. That it is different with
induction another example will show.

<p>
<center>
            S', S'', S''', and S'''' are taken as samples of the
                collection M;<br>
                
            S', S'', S''', and S'''' are P:<br>
            
       [Ergo,] All M is P.
</center>       
       <p>

      Hence the first premiss amounts to saying that "S', S'',
S''', and S''''" is an index of M. Hence the premisses are an
index of the conclusion.

<p>

      The other divisions of terms, propositions, and arguments
arise <a name="W2.59"></a>from the distinction of extension and comprehension. I
propose to treat this subject in a subsequent paper. But I will so
far anticipate that as to say that there is, first, the direct
reference of a symbol to its objects, or its denotation; second,
the reference of the symbol to its ground, through its object,
that is, its reference to the common characters of its objects, or
its connotation; and third, its reference to its interpretants
through its object, that is, its reference to all the synthetical
propositions in which its objects in common are subject or
predicate, and this I term the information it embodies. And as
every addition to what it denotes, or to what it connotes, is
effected by means of a distinct proposition of this kind, it
follows that the extension and comprehension of a term are in an
inverse relation, as long as the information remains the same, and
that every increase of information is accompanied by an increase
of one or other of these two quantities. It may be observed that
extension and comprehension are very often taken in other senses
in which this last proposition is not true.

<p>

      This is an imperfect view of the application which the
conceptions which, according to our analysis, are the most
fundamental ones find in the sphere of logic. It is believed,
however, that it is sufficient to show that at least something may
be usefully suggested by considering this science in this light.

<h2>Notes</h2>
